# kwadbuilds.com-Product-Updates
Kwadbuilds.com is an affiliate drone parts website that I founded and am in charge of product management for (I did not design the website itself). This is the code for updating all the products in the kwadbuilds.com google sheets database. It uses the selenium and gspread python libraries. I had to omit the credentials inside the json file as this information is confidential. It should, however, still help show what the code does.
